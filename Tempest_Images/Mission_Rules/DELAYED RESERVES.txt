In this mission, until the start of the third battle round, each time a Strategic Reserve or Reinforcement unit from a playerâ€™s army wishes to arrive on the battlefield, that player must make a reserve roll for it. To do so, that player rolls one D6 adding 1 to the result if it is the third battle round, on 3 that unit arrives as normal. Otherwise the roll fails and that unit does not arrive this turn.
