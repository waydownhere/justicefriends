In this mission, if a player controls an objective marker at the end of their Command phase, and one or more units from their army that are within range of that objective marker have the Objective Secured ability, then that objective marker remains under their control, even if they have no models within range of it, unless their opponent controls it at the end of any subsequent phase.
