While this secondary mission is active, keep an Attrition tally for both players. Add 1 to each player’s Attrition tally each time a unit from their opponent’s army is destroyed. At the end of your opponent’s next turn, or at the end of the battle (whichever happens first), compare these Attrition tallies: if yours is higher than your opponent’s, then this secondary mission is achieved. Otherwise you must discard this secondary mission.
