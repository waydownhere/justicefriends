This secondary mission is achieved when a unit from your army completes the Deploy Teleport Homer action (see below).

Deploy Teleport Homer (Action): One unit from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase if it is wholly within your opponentâ€™s deployment zone. If the unit performing the action is INFANTRY or if it has the Objective Secured ability, this action is completed at the end of your turn; otherwise it is completed at the start of your next Command phase.
