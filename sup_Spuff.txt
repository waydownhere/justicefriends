Okay, this is the deal. I know what the problem has been. Cool that I can kinda figure it all out by 
doing. I set the location of the Github repository on my local machine here, which is fine for our purposes, but I was trying to create a text file, and then follow it up by 'git push' and i would get all kinds of error messages. I now understand that I was having a bit of a smooth brain moment.
I needed to be doing 'git commit'. I am not pushing it to an upstream branch, there IS not a branch furhter upstream, this is the repository.
